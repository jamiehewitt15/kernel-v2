# ðŸŒ  Module 0 - An Introduction to Kernel

Kernel is an 8 week program, and we'll be covering a new learning module each week. 
Each module is made up of two sections: **Crafted Reading**, which we will expect you to 
have read before the beginning of each new week; and **Curated Material** which is made up of 
articles, videos, and the occasional podcast that we _highly recommend_ you go over before the 
Fireside Chat each week.

The Learn Track aims to provide a more holistic framing of what Web 3 is â€” its principles, 
history, and present state. We know that different people learn differently, hence the mix of 
text, video and audio. The "Crafted Readings" have emojis next to them in the menu and you will need 
to have read both pieces to participate fully in this week's activities. The "Curated Material" is highly 
recommended if you are the sort of person who feels like they might want to add value to any of 
the spontaneous conversations which no doubt will spring up in the course of the work.

## Spaced Repetition

Based on work we'll cover in module 3, Kernel aims to present learning in a new kind of medium which integrates a spaced-repetition memory system. This means you'll need to return to do  future reviews. In a conventional course, youâ€™d forget most of what you learned over time, perhaps retaining a handful of ideas. However, with spaced repetition built into the medium, a small additional commitment of time means you will remember significantly more. Doing this wonâ€™t be difficult, it will be easier than the initial read. Furthermore, youâ€™ll be able to read other material which builds on these ideas. It will open up an entire world.

Please indulge us by answering the questions you find in the text. For each question, think about what you believe the answer to be, click to reveal the actual answer, and then mark whether you remembered or not. If you can recall, thatâ€™s great. If not, thatâ€™s also fine, just note the correct answer and continue.

This spaced-repetition approach is why the questions only require a few seconds to read and answer. Theyâ€™re not complex exercises, in the style of a textbook. Rather, the questions have a different point: the promise each question makes is that you will remember the answer forever. Itâ€™s to permanently change your thinking.

Q: What is my purpose?

A: To change how you think! (And to pass the butter, of course)

## Cultured Conversation

Meaningful conversation can only take place in a culture of respect and courtesy, between people 
who are capable of seeing their highest ideals in others and who can recognise and reflect the 
essential sameness which lies at the heart of each and every human being. 

We tend to only engage in conversations which we think we can "take something away from", be it new knowledge, an altered perspective, or an inside story we can leverage for our own gain. However, Kernel conversations are about *humility*, *presence* and a *genuine attentiveness* 
towards others, not because you stand to benefit from them, but because cultivating these three 
capacities within yourself is its own reward, which may allow you to see clearly the complete 
and perfect sacred core of every person you encounter.

Whatâ€™s perfectly whole seems flawed,  
but you can use it forever.  
Whatâ€™s perfectly full seems empty,  
but you canâ€™t use it up.  
  
True straightness looks crooked.  
Great skill looks clumsy.  
Real eloquence seems to stammer.  
  
To be comfortable in the cold, keep moving;  
to be comfortable in the heat, hold still;  
to be comfortable in the world, stay calm and clear.
